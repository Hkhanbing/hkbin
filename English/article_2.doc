    When choosing a job, many people always think that the salary is the most important consideration. However,
I have a differ opinion.
    Apart from the salary, holidays are equally important. Holidays can help us find a sense of spiritual freedom.
Holidays not only give us time to do whatever we want, fulfilling our mind and relaxing our body, but also improve 
interpersonal communication, enhancing the feelings between friends.
    In addition, working hours are the same prominence. When the working hours are too long, even take half a day, 
My mood would be terrible, tired will fill up my mind. This leads to physically and mentally exhausted, which would let us lose the interest in the work. That is why working hours are the same 
prominence, even more important.
    Above all, work environment is equally or even more important. Having a perfect environment, on one hand, it would give us the
motivation to work. On the other hand, we would experience a more happier and more pleasure work in working time, both of which
would surely conducive to the improvement of work and ability.
    All in all, when choosing a job, although salary is important, more conditions should also be noted. Apart from the salary, we should also take care of the
satisfaction it would gives us. The more it gives us, the more comfortable it will be in the work.
